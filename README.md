Then we have continued our work by sprint 1 where we presented the User Interface (UI) part of our project to develop JEE. Then in the sprint 2 section we developed our web application using ASP.Net. Subsequently, for Sprint 3 we have focused on the development of the second section of the User Interface application in JSF. Finally, we will study the Sprint 4 which would demonstrate the application with sharepoint.
